One way to improve results without changing the model architecture is to employ a more complex decoding algorithm, including beam search or sampling-based decoding techniques. These techniques examine multiple word sequences rather than simply the most likely one at each stage, which can lead to more varied and coherent translations while also decreasing the likelihood of making mistakes, repeating common phrases, or becoming stuck in loops. Better results can also be achieved by incorporating strategies like context-based decoding (which enables the model to produce more pertinent and appropriate responses based on the provided context) or adding a language model as a post-processing step (which enables the model to produce more fluid and grammatically accurate translations by taking into account the language structure and rules).
Using a larger and more varied training dataset can also help the model generalize better and correct any faults or inaccuracies that may have resulted from its lack of exposure to certain phrases or idiomatic expressions. 
Additionally, fine-tuning the model on a task-specific dataset can also lead to better results. This is because it enables the model to adjust to the unique traits and variances of the target language and domain, producing translations that are more accurate.
